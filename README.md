## Code Self-Portrait
##### by Maj Jenkins
February 11, 2021

### Overview

For my self portrait, I wanted to try and capture the essence of constantly being in change and transit. I also wanted to represent how I see myself spiritually formed by my environment. I don't believe in the sense of the self alone, I believe that we are all influenced by those around us and the physical place which surrounds us: our homes, our neighborhoods, etc. To accomplish this, I attempted to imitate the sky in my depiction of myself by using shades of blue and clouds. For the message of this project, I wrote a short poetic snippet about how I am still "weaving" my life, that this, myself, as everything else, is a work in progress, and never fully finished or complete. To add to this theme of "weaving", I made the background of this project a grid pattern and bordered by animated "threads".
    
Functionality in this project includes making the sketch fullscreen by pressing F and moving the mouse to move the clouds.
